Dear Fans,

     We regret to announce that the old beloved
program has now been completely flushed.  Please
realize that this is in accordance with our
tradition and constant effort of trying to bring
you the best trivia service available on the net.
With our limited manpower and scarce resources
we are unable to maintain two systems at the same
time.

     For those who have a strong sentimental
attachment to the demised trivia, we offer the
following special, once in a lifetime offer:

          The Giant, Encyclopedic,
                67 block long
             ******************
      ==> !!! LIBRDR;TV LISTNG !!! <==
             ******************
                containing
         a COMPLETE listing of ALL
         questions and answers ever
         created in the old Trivia.
        (Yes, sir all 1462 of them!!)

                    and
           portable, bite-size versions
            in the 16-volume series of
         *******************************
  ==> !!! LIBRDR;TVQUES 1-8 & TVANS 1-8 !!! <==
         *******************************
	    (not available in stores)

     Either the combined or the series version 
would make perfect Christmas or birthday presents.
They would be enjoyed and remembered by generations
to come.  Please hurry, with our limited disk
resources (not to mention villain adminstrators)
this offer will not last long!  FTP, XGP or TPL
it at your earliest convenience!

                             Trivially,
                                 TRIVIA@DMS.
