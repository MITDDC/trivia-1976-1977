I. On the Road to the ASYLUM.

    All high-quality TRIVIA maintainers must have a small but
finite knowledge of the workings of ASYLUMs (refer to MARC;ASYLUM >).
Asylums have the following obscure features:
	Page 0 - MFD page / Octal Words to the Wise

		 0. Unused
		 1&2. Disk format date/time for lock hacking
		 3. Unused
		 4. Allocator Lock
		 5. Unused/used horribly
		 6. Highest legal address for data
		 7&10. Unused
		11. Pointer to free block chain
		12. First of Directory Pointers
		77. Last Directory Pointer
	       100. First Page Lock (each locks 3 pages)
	      1777. Last Page Lock

	Page 1 - ALLOCATOR page / More gems of trivial knowledge

		0. AOBJN pointer to Top of the Allocator (good for dinner, too)
		1. Highest ID used + 1
		2. SETZ n /or 0 -- where n is a pointer to start of free ID chain
	   3-1777. Allocation table entries (length/start of block)

    Directories are hidden at the top end of the file and grow towards the
middle.  The data area starts at 4000 (octal) and also grows to the middle
of the file.  When they meet, run for cover!

    A directory is made up of 4 word blocks whose meanings are as follows:
		1. Lock word (-1 ==> free  0 ==> locked)
		2. Pointer to Block that data calls home.
		3. Length of that block if positive
		   -or-
		   Pointer to next free ID on free ID chain (if 4.9 bit set)
		4. Data word (for DATA-PRINTW, etc)

    A data block is made up of a 5 word header followed by the data itself.
The words of the header are:
		1. Use word (+ number of people reading this block)
		2. Unused
		3. Chain pointer to next free data block if N==? 0
		4. Unused
		5. Length of block INCLUDING header

    In addition to the data block header, insane MANIACS created in MADMAN
spaces use an additional 6 words of header but their meaning in obscure and
their value is left for philosophers to decide.  No person in his right mind
attempts to grok this.

    The following magic incantations may be useful to a fifth-level magic user.
	1. <DATA-FIND <asylum> <id number>>
	   returns the directory block for that ID

	2. <DATA-OPEN <mode>      ; "PRINT" "READ" or "PRINTW"
		      <id number> ; -1 for a brand new ID if in PRINT mode
		      <asylum>>
	   returns a MANIAC or FALSE

	3. <DATA-BLOCK <maniac>
		       <asylum>
		       <length of block>>
	   returns the location of the allocated block or FALSE

	4. <DATA-CLOSE <maniac> <asylum>>
	   returns the MANIAC

	5. <DATA-APRINT <asylum> <id number> <space> <object>>
	   returns the MANIAC created

	6. <DATA-IPRINT <maniac> <asylum> <space> <object>>
	   is like DATA-APRINT with a DATA-OPEN done previously

	7. <DATA-AREAD <asylum> <id number> <space>>
	   returns the object.

	8. <DATA-IREAD <maniac> <asylum> <space>>
	   is the analog of DATA-IREAD.

	9. <DATA-PRINTW <id number> <asylum> <primtype word>>
	   returns the MANIAC
	   
       10. <DATA-READW <id number> <asylum>>
	   returns a <primtype word>

       11. <DIR-FIND <asylum> <id number>>
	   returns the page number in core of the directory on which <id number>
	   lives.  It obviously maps the page in, if it wasn't already.

       12. <OPEN-DATA-FILE <file name>>
	   opens an ASYLUM.  There are some optional arguments which are not
	   really necessary to grok.

       13. <DATA-PUT <asylum> <id number> <uvector [dir header]>>
	   BE CAREFUL!

       14. <DATA-DELETE <id number> <asylum>>
	   deletes this item

       15. <DATA-BLOCK-FREE <asylum> <location of start of block>>
	   deallocates that block

       16. <NAME-BLOCK-FREE <id number> <asylum>>
	   deallocates the name area for <id number>

       17. <DATA-RENAME <id number> <asylum> <id number>>
	   the obvious.  May not be debugged totally.
