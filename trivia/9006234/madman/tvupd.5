NEW INTERFACE FOR MATCHING QUESTIONS
	A new interface for answering matching questions has been
installed.
	The new scheme first prints the question, then prompts with
"Match "; at this point, the user should type in one of the choices from
column a (1. Mumble foo, for example); ctrl-F will, as usual, list all of
the available choices.  If the user types <esc>, the lowest-numbered
choice which has not yet been answered will be selected.  When all
choices have been answered, the default is to finish with the question;
therefore, by always answering <esc> to this, you will proceed through
column A in order.  When the choice has been completed, TRIVIA will
prompt with "with ", whereupon the user should, as in the old scheme,
enter something from column b.  It is possible to provide an answer for
one of the choices from column a several times, thus making it quite
convenient to change answers; it is also possible to not provide answers
for items from column a.  To assist the user in determining which items
he has provided answers for, ctrl-F for column a will mark those which
have been answered with a "+".  When all has been answered satisfactorily,
answer <cr> to the match prompt.

HINTS
	On long answer questions, the author will be asked for a "hint"
immediately after giving the question.  If one is given, he will then
be asked what fraction of the total question value the question will be
worth if it is answered after seeing the hint.  He is then asked for
another hint, and so on.  When answering such questions, TRIVIA
indicates if there is a hint remaining, and how much the question will
be worth if answered after the hint is seen.  When you give up on a
question which has hints, TRIVIA will display the hint and ask again,
until there are no more hints.

Other changes
	Teleconferencing has been reinstated.  However, immediate
reading (formerly a switch) is not available.  It may be at some time in
the future, but will never be as immediate as it formerly was.  Also,
the new.match switch has been flushed, since the new match interface has
been installed as the only match interface.
